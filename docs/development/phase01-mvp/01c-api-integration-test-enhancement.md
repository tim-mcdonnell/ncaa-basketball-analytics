# ESPN API Integration Test Enhancement

## 🎯 Overview

**Background:** The ESPN API integration has basic test coverage, but comprehensive test fixtures and more thorough test cases are needed to ensure robustness, especially for edge cases and error scenarios.

**Objective:** Enhance the test coverage for the ESPN API client by creating comprehensive test fixtures and implementing additional test cases.

**Scope:** This task focuses specifically on testing improvements without making significant functional changes to the API client itself. It includes creating additional test fixtures, implementing more thorough test cases, and ensuring proper edge case handling.

```

### Mock API Response Factory

Create a reusable factory for generating consistent mock API responses:

```python
class MockResponseFactory:
    """Factory for creating mock ESPN API responses for testing."""

    @staticmethod
    def load_fixture(fixture_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load a fixture from the fixtures directory."""
        fixture_file = os.path.join(
            os.path.dirname(__file__),
            "fixtures",
            fixture_path
        )
        with open(fixture_file, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)

    @classmethod
    def create_team_response(cls, variation: str = "normal") -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Create a mock team API response."""
        variations = {
            "normal": "teams/team_detail.json",
            "no_record": "teams/team_without_record.json",
            "string_record": "teams/team_with_string_record.json",
        }
        return cls.load_fixture(variations.get(variation, variations["normal"]))

    # Add similar methods for games, players, etc.
```

### Rate Limiting Test Helper

Create a helper class for testing rate limiting behavior:

```python
class RateLimiterTestHelper:
    """Helper for testing adaptive rate limiting behavior."""

    @staticmethod
    async def simulate_rate_limited_requests(
        client: AsyncESPNClient,
        endpoint: str,
        num_requests: int = 20
    ) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        """
        Simulate a sequence of API requests with rate limiting.

        Returns:
            Tuple[int, int]: (successful requests, failed requests)
        """
        success_count = 0
        failure_count = 0

        for i in range(num_requests):
            try:
                await client.get(endpoint)
                success_count += 1
            except RateLimitError:
                failure_count += 1

        return success_count, failure_count
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test-Driven Development Process
