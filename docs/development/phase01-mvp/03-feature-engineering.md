# Feature Engineering Framework

This document provides technical details for implementing the feature engineering framework component of Phase 01 MVP.

## 🎯 Overview

**Background:** Feature engineering is the critical bridge between raw data and effective machine learning models, providing the predictive signals that enable accurate basketball analytics.

**Objective:** Establish an extensible system for calculating, storing, and managing features for machine learning models.

**Scope:** This component will handle feature dependencies, versioning, efficient computation using Polars and DuckDB, and provide a consistent interface for model training.

    # Register mocks with the registry
    registry.register_instance("team_wins", mock_wins_feature)
    registry.register_instance("team_losses", mock_losses_feature)

    # Act
    win_pct_calculator = registry.get_feature("team_win_percentage")
    result = win_pct_calculator.compute(team_id="test_team")

    # Assert
    assert result == 0.75
    mock_wins_feature.compute.assert_called_once_with(team_id="test_team", start_date=None, end_date=None)

    version="1.0.0",
    dependencies=["team_wins", "team_losses"]
)
class TeamWinPercentage(TeamFeature):
    def compute(self, team_id, start_date=None, end_date=None):
