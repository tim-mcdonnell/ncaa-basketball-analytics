# ESPN API Integration Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

**Background:** The initial implementation of the ESPN API integration has established a solid foundation for data collection. However, there are several opportunities to enhance test coverage, improve code organization, and strengthen the component's resilience.

**Objective:** Implement specific enhancements to the ESPN API integration component to improve test coverage, code quality, and maintainability.

**Scope:** This task focuses on improving the existing API integration codebase without altering its core functionality or interfaces. Improvements include better test coverage, code organization, error handling, and documentation.

│   └── game_detail.json     # Mock response for single game
└── players/
    └── team_roster.json   # Mock response for team roster
```

### Code Organization Improvements

```
src/data/api/espn_client/
├── __init__.py            # Export AsyncESPNClient
├── base.py                # Core ESPN client functionality
├── teams.py               # Team-specific client methods
├── games.py               # Game-specific client methods
└── players.py             # Player-specific client methods
```

### Configuration Management

```
config/
└── api/
    └── espn.yaml          # ESPN API configuration
```

```yaml
# Example ESPN API configuration
espn:
  base_url: "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/mens-college-basketball"
  timeout: 30
  retries:
    max_attempts: 3
    min_wait: 1.0
    max_wait: 10.0
    factor: 2.0
  rate_limiting:
    initial: 10
    min_limit: 1
    max_limit: 50
    success_threshold: 10
    failure_threshold: 3
  metadata:
    dir: "data/metadata"
    file: "espn_metadata.json"
```

### Enhanced Error Recovery

```python
# Improved error recovery mechanism example
async def get_with_enhanced_recovery(self, endpoint, params=None, max_recovery_attempts=2):
    """
    Make GET request with enhanced recovery for intermittent API issues.

    Args:
        endpoint: API endpoint
        params: Request parameters
        max_recovery_attempts: Maximum recovery attempts for intermittent issues

    Returns:
        Response data
    """
    recovery_attempt = 0
    last_exception = None

    # Regular retry mechanism will handle standard retries
    # This adds an additional recovery layer for intermittent issues
    while recovery_attempt <= max_recovery_attempts:
        try:
            return await self.get(endpoint, params)
        except (ServiceUnavailableError, ConnectionResetError) as e:
            last_exception = e
            recovery_attempt += 1

            # Use longer waits for recovery attempts
            backoff_time = min(30, 5 * 2 ** recovery_attempt)
            logger.warning(
                f"Recovery attempt {recovery_attempt}/{max_recovery_attempts} "
                f"for {endpoint}. Waiting {backoff_time}s before retry."
            )
            await asyncio.sleep(backoff_time)

    # If we exhausted recovery attempts, raise the last exception
    logger.error(f"Enhanced recovery failed after {max_recovery_attempts} attempts")
    raise last_exception
```

### Response Validation

```python
# Enhanced response validation with Pydantic
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

class TeamResponse(BaseModel):
    """Pydantic model for ESPN team API response validation."""
    id: str
    name: str
    abbreviation: Optional[str] = ""
    location: Optional[str] = ""
    logo: Optional[str] = None
    record: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None

    @validator('record', pre=True)
    def extract_record_summary(cls, v):
        """Extract record summary from nested structure."""
        if isinstance(v, dict) and 'items' in v and v['items']:
            return v['items'][0].get('summary', '0-0')
        return v or '0-0'
```

async def fetch_team_data():
    async with AsyncESPNClient() as client:
        # Get all teams
        teams = await client.get_teams()

        # Get details for a specific team
        team = await client.get_team("59")  # Michigan
