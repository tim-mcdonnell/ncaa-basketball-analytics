    # Assert
    assert team_selector is not None
    # Check that the dropdown component exists
    assert any(component.id == 'team-dropdown' for component in team_selector.children)
    # Check that all teams are in the options
    dropdown = [c for c in team_selector.children if getattr(c, 'id', None) == 'team-dropdown'][0]
