# ESPN API Integration

This document provides technical details for implementing the ESPN API integration component of Phase 1 MVP.

## Overview

The ESPN API integration component will establish a reliable data collection framework from ESPN's public and authenticated APIs, focusing on college basketball data. The component will handle authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and data validation.

## Architecture

```

└── data/
    └── api/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── client.py        # Base API client with auth and rate limiting
        ├── espn_client.py   # ESPN-specific client implementation
        ├── endpoints/       # Endpoint implementations
        │   ├── __init__.py

        │   ├── games.py     # Game data endpoints
        │   └── players.py   # Player data endpoints
        └── models/          # Data models for API responses

```

## Technical Requirements

### API Client

1. Base API client class must implement:
   - Rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Authentication handling
   - Request/response logging
   - Error handling with appropriate retries
   - Timeout configuration

2. ESPN-specific client must implement:
   - API key management (if required)
   - ESPN-specific endpoints
   - Error response handling

### Data Models

1. Pydantic models for all API responses to ensure:
   - Type validation
   - Default values for missing fields
   - Conversion of ESPN data format to internal format

### Endpoints

1. Teams endpoint:
   - Retrieve list of all NCAA basketball teams
   - Retrieve detailed information for specific teams
   - Handle conference and division filtering

2. Games endpoint:
   - Retrieve game schedule data
   - Retrieve game results and statistics
   - Support filtering by date range, team, or conference
   - Handle game status (scheduled, in-progress, completed)

3. Players endpoint:
   - Retrieve player roster by team
   - Retrieve player statistics
   - Handle active/inactive player status

### Incremental Data Collection

1. Track last successful data collection timestamp
2. Support incremental updates based on:
   - New games added to schedule
   - Game status changes
   - Updated statistics

### Testing Requirements

1. Mock ESPN API responses for all endpoints
2. Test rate limiting behavior
3. Test error handling and retries
4. Test data validation for various API response scenarios
5. Test incremental data collection logic

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic client initialization
from src.data.api.espn_client import ESPNClient

client = ESPNClient()

# Retrieving all teams
teams = client.get_teams()

# Retrieving games for a specific date range
from datetime import datetime
start_date = datetime(2023, 11, 1)
end_date = datetime(2023, 11, 30)
games = client.get_games(start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)

# Retrieving player data for a team
team_id = "59"  # Example team ID
players = client.get_team_players(team_id=team_id)
```

## Implementation Approach

1. First implement and test the base API client with rate limiting and error handling
2. Next implement the teams endpoint with basic data validation
3. Then implement the games endpoint with appropriate filtering
4. Finally implement the players endpoint
5. Add incremental data collection logic

## Integration Points

- **Output**: API client will provide validated data to the data storage component
- **Configuration**: Client will read rate limiting and API parameters from config files
- **Logging**: All API activity will be logged using the project's logging system

## Technical Challenges

1. **API Stability**: ESPN APIs may change without notice; design should handle this gracefully
2. **Rate Limiting**: Need to respect ESPN's rate limits to avoid being blocked
3. **Data Consistency**: NCAA data can be inconsistent; validation must be robust

## Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**: >99% success rate for API requests with appropriate retries
2. **Coverage**: All required data points successfully collected
3. **Efficiency**: Minimal redundant API calls through effective caching and incremental fetching
