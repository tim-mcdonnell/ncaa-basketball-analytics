# Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product Implementation

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing Phase 1 (MVP) of the NCAA Basketball Analytics project as referenced in the [development phases roadmap](../architecture/development-phases.md).

## Overview

The MVP will establish the foundational architecture with basic end-to-end functionality, focusing on creating a working pipeline from data collection to visualization with minimally viable features.

## Development Approach

All development will follow test-driven development principles as specified in the [AI Agent Cheat Sheet](../guides/processes/ai-agent-cheatsheet.md):

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Document implementation details

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Upon successful completion of Phase 1, development will transition to Phase 2: Comprehensive Feature Engineering, focusing on expanding the feature set to capture the complexity of basketball performance.
