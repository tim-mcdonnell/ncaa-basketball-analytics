## Development Approach

All development will strictly follow test-driven development principles:

1. Write failing tests first that verify functionality and alignment with architecture
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Document implementation details and architecture alignment

Each component must be implemented following these TDD principles, with tests explicitly verifying that implementations adhere to the architectural specifications in the relevant documentation.

## Global Success Criteria

In addition to component-specific success criteria, the Phase 01 MVP must meet the following global criteria:

1. All implementations conform to their respective architecture documents
2. Test coverage meets minimum threshold (>80%)
3. Documentation is complete and aligned with implementation
4. Project structure follows the organization defined in project-structure.md

## Next Steps After Phase 01

Upon successful completion of Phase 01, development will transition to Phase 02: Comprehensive Feature Engineering, focusing on expanding the feature set to capture the complexity of basketball performance.
