# GitHub Issue Management Guide

This guide outlines best practices for creating, tracking, and resolving GitHub issues for the NCAA Basketball Analytics project, with a focus on handling complex tasks with multiple sub-components.

## üìã Issue Types and Organization

Our project uses GitHub issues to track:

- **Feature implementations**: New capabilities aligned with our phase milestones
- **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing components
- **Bugs**: Issues that need to be fixed
- **Documentation**: Documentation tasks

Each issue should be:
1. Associated with a milestone (phase)
2. Clearly titled with the component and action
3. Thoroughly documented with requirements and acceptance criteria

## üß† AI Agent Considerations

When creating issues for AI agent implementation, special considerations apply:

### Conversation-to-Issue Translation

When converting from project discussions to formal issues:

```markdown
## üí¨ Conversation Context

**Origin:** [Brief reference to conversation date/topic]

**Key Decisions:**
- Decision 1: [Specific choice made during discussion]
- Decision 2: [Specific choice made during discussion]

**Discarded Alternatives:**
- Alternative 1: [Approach considered but rejected] - Reason: [Why rejected]
- Alternative 2: [Approach considered but rejected] - Reason: [Why rejected]
```

### Context Persistence

Include sufficient context for the AI agent to work independently:

```markdown
## üß© Required Context

**Assumed Knowledge:**
- [Specific technical concept/pattern the AI should understand]
- [Project convention that applies to this task]

**Related Components:**
- Component 1: [Brief description of related system component]
- Component 2: [Brief description of related system component]

**Reference Examples:**
- Example 1: [Link to similar implementation in the codebase]
```

### Disambiguation Patterns

Prevent ambiguity by explicitly defining boundaries:

```markdown
## üîç Scope Clarification

**Include:**
- [Specific item that should be included]
- [Specific item that should be included]

**Exclude:**
- [Specific item outside the scope]
- [Specific item outside the scope]

**If Ambiguous:**
- For situation X: Prefer approach A
- For situation Y: Defer to pattern in [reference file/component]
```

## üîÑ Managing Sub-Tasks

During development, you'll often identify related work that supports your primary task. We handle these situations differently based on timing:

### Approach 1: Sub-Tasks for Same Development Cycle

When you identify sub-tasks that will be completed **before the current PR**:

1. **Create a Main Issue** for the principal task
   ```
   Title: ESPN API Integration Implementation
   ```

2. **Document Sub-Tasks as a Checklist** within the main issue
   ```markdown
   ## üìã Sub-Task Overview

   - [x] **01 - Initial API Client Implementation**: Core client with async processing, rate limiting, and API endpoints
   - [x] **01a - API Integration Improvements**: Enhanced test coverage, code organization, error handling
   - [x] **01b - API Integration Refactoring**: Resolved duplication, modularized code, expanded functionality
   - [x] **01c - API Integration Test Enhancement**: Comprehensive test fixtures and edge case handling
   ```

3. **Keep Detailed Documentation** in the project's docs folder
   ```
   docs/development/phase01-mvp/01-api-integration.md
   docs/development/phase01-mvp/01a-api-integration-improvements.md
   docs/development/phase01-mvp/01b-api-integration-refactoring.md
   docs/development/phase01-mvp/01c-api-integration-test-enhancement.md
   ```

4. **Update the Issue Checklist** as you complete each sub-task

5. **Create a Single PR** that covers all related sub-tasks

### Approach 2: Tasks for Future Development Cycles

When you identify work that will be addressed **after the current PR**:

1. **Complete and PR Current Work** with its main GitHub issue

2. **Create Separate Issues** for future enhancements
   ```
   Title: Enhance ESPN API Client Error Recovery
   ```

3. **Link Back to Original Issue**
   ```markdown
   This enhancement was identified during the implementation of #1 (ESPN API Integration Implementation).
   ```

4. **Apply the Milestone** to keep these tasks associated with the right project phase

## ‚úÖ Issue Content Guidelines

A well-structured issue should include:

### For Implementation Tasks

```markdown
# Component Name Implementation

Brief overview of the task and its purpose.

## üìã Sub-Task Overview

- [ ] Sub-task 1: Brief description
- [ ] Sub-task 2: Brief description

## üéØ Component Overview

**Background:** Context behind this component
**Objective:** What this component aims to achieve
**Scope:** What's included and excluded

## üìê Technical Implementation

### Architecture

Description of the component architecture (if applicable)

### Key Features to Implement

1. **Feature Category 1**
   - Feature detail
   - Feature detail

2. **Feature Category 2**
   - Feature detail
   - Feature detail

## üß™ Testing Considerations

- Key testing approaches
- Special test cases to consider

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Process

1. Step 1 of implementation
2. Step 2 of implementation

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

### For Bug Reports

```markdown
# Bug: [Brief Description]

## Description
Clear description of the bug

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Expected Behavior
What should happen

## Actual Behavior
What actually happens

## Environment
- Version: [version]
- OS: [OS]

## Possible Fix
If you have ideas, share them here
```

## üìä Issue Tracking Workflow

1. **Creation**: Create issue with full details and milestone
2. **Assignment**: Assign to a team member
3. **Implementation**: Developer works on the issue, updating sub-task checklist
4. **PR Creation**: Create PR that references the issue (`Fixes #X`)
5. **Review**: PR is reviewed and approved
6. **Merge**: PR is merged, automatically closing the issue

## üîç AI Agent Issue Verification

Before submitting an issue for AI implementation, verify it has:

```markdown
## ‚úì AI Implementation Checklist

- [ ] All ambiguous terms are clearly defined
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (what's in/out)
- [ ] Required background context is included
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are machine-verifiable
- [ ] Testing requirements include specific test cases
- [ ] All related files and components are identified
- [ ] Decision pathways for edge cases are provided
```

## üåü Example: ESPN API Integration

The [ESPN API Integration Implementation](https://github.com/tim-mcdonnell/ncaa-basketball-analytics/issues/1) issue demonstrates our approach:

1. We started with a primary task for the API integration
2. During development, we identified three additional sub-tasks:
   - API integration improvements
   - API integration refactoring
   - API integration test enhancement
3. We documented each sub-task thoroughly
4. We tracked progress with the checklist in the main issue
5. All work was completed in a single development cycle and PR

## üîç Tips for Effective Issue Management

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what needs to be done
2. **Use Templates**: Follow consistent patterns for similar issues
3. **Link Related Issues**: Use GitHub's referencing system
4. **Update Progress**: Keep checklists and status updated
5. **Document Decisions**: Record key decisions in comments

## üöÄ Getting Started

For your next task:

1. Create the GitHub issue using this guide
2. Set up the appropriate documentation structure
3. Track progress using the checklist approach
4. Reference the issue in your PR

By following these practices, we'll maintain a clean and organized GitHub issue history while still capturing the complexity of our development process.
