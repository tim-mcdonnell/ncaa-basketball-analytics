# Configuration Management Architecture

This document describes the architectural design and implementation details of the configuration management system in the NCAA Basketball Analytics project.

## System Overview

The configuration system is designed to provide a flexible, type-safe, and environment-aware way to manage application settings. It follows these core architectural principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration definition is separated from loading and validation
- **Type Safety**: All configuration values are validated against Pydantic models
- **Environment Awareness**: Different environments can have different configuration values
- **Extensibility**: The system can be extended with new configuration sections without changing the core

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Config Class**: Central entry point that orchestrates loading and validation
2. **Config Models**: Pydantic models defining the structure and validation rules
3. **Loaders**: Components responsible for loading configuration from different sources
4. **Environment Manager**: Determines and manages the current environment

## Class Structure

```

### Key Classes

#### `Config` Class

The `Config` class is the main entry point for the configuration system:

```python
class Config:
    """Central configuration class that manages loading and access to configuration."""

    @classmethod
    def load(cls, env=None, config_dir=None):
        """Load configuration for the specified environment."""
        # Implementation

    def get(self, path, default=None):
        """Get a configuration value by path."""
        # Implementation

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        """Support for dot notation access."""
        # Implementation
```

#### Configuration Models

Pydantic models define the structure and validation rules:

```python
class ApiConfig(BaseModel):
    """API configuration settings."""
    base_url: str
    timeout: int = 30
    rate_limit: int = 100

class DatabaseConfig(BaseModel):
    """Database connection settings."""
    host: str
    port: int
    name: str
    user: str
    password: str = ""

class RootConfig(BaseModel):
    """Root configuration model."""
    version: str
    api: ApiConfig
    database: DatabaseConfig
    features: FeaturesConfig
    models: ModelsConfig
    dashboard: DashboardConfig
```

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - The system first loads the base configuration
   - Then it loads environment-specific overrides
   - Finally, it applies environment variable overrides

2. **Validation Process**:
   - Raw configuration data is validated against Pydantic models
   - Type coercion is applied where possible
   - Validation errors are collected and reported

3. **Configuration Access**:
   - Configuration values can be accessed via dot notation
   - Values can also be accessed via dictionary-style lookup
   - Path-based access is supported for deep configuration nesting

## Version Compatibility

The configuration system includes version compatibility checking:

1. Each configuration file includes a version number
2. The system checks that the version is compatible with the expected version
3. Minor version increases are backward compatible
4. Major version increases require explicit migration

## Environment Variable Integration

Environment variables can override configuration values:

1. Environment variables with the prefix `NCAA_BASKETBALL_` are recognized
2. The remainder of the variable name is converted to a configuration path
3. Values are automatically coerced to the expected type when possible

## Error Handling

The configuration system provides detailed error messages:

1. Validation errors include the path to the invalid value
2. Type errors explain what type was expected vs. received
3. Missing required values are clearly identified
4. Version incompatibilities explain the version mismatch

## Extension Points

The configuration system can be extended in several ways:

1. **New Configuration Sections**: Add new models to `models.py`
2. **Custom Validators**: Add custom validators in `validators.py`
3. **Additional Sources**: Extend the loading system in `loaders.py`
4. **Caching**: Implement configuration caching for performance

## Dependencies

The configuration system has minimal dependencies:

- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management
- **PyYAML**: For loading YAML configuration files
- **Python 3.8+**: For type hinting and modern language features

## Performance Considerations

The configuration system is optimized for startup performance:

1. Configuration is loaded once at application startup
2. Pydantic models are used for efficient validation
3. Dot notation access is optimized for frequent lookups
