## Task Management Approach

### Recommendation

For this project, we recommend a hybrid approach to task management:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Use for tracking active development tasks, bugs, and feature requests
   - Create milestone tags matching the development phases
   - Use labels to categorize tasks by component (API, Models, Features, etc.)
   - Link PRs to issues for traceability

2. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed specifications in the project documentation
   - Use `docs/development/` folder for detailed specifications
   - Organize by phase and component
   - Include requirements, design decisions, and implementation guidance

3. **Task Description Format**: Follow the [Task Writing Guide](../guides/processes/task-writing-guide.md) to create clear, actionable tasks
   - Structured format with explicit requirements
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Specific testing instructions
   - References to relevant architecture components

## Progress Tracking

To track progress against these milestones:

1. **Weekly Reviews**: Regular review of open issues and milestone progress
2. **Completion Criteria**: Clear definition of done for each task
3. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation
4. **Milestone Reports**: Generate reports at milestone completion

!!! note "Flexibility"
    This phased approach provides structure but allows for adaptation as requirements evolve and insights emerge during development. Phases may overlap or be adjusted based on progress and priorities.

## Testing Approach

Each development phase includes corresponding test development:

- **Phase 01**: Basic unit tests and integration tests for core functionality
- **Phase 02**: Feature validation tests and data quality checks
- **Phase 03**: Model performance tests and evaluation metrics
- **Phase 04**: UI/UX tests and dashboard functionality testing
- **Phase 05**: Tournament simulation and prediction accuracy testing

## Getting Started

To begin work on a specific phase:

1. Review the phase's key deliverables in this document
2. Check GitHub issues assigned to the relevant milestone
3. Refer to detailed specifications in the `docs/development/` directory
4. Follow the [project workflow](project-structure.md) for development
