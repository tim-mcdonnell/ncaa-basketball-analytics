# ESPN API Refactoring

## Overview

This PR refactors the ESPN API client implementation to resolve code duplication issues, improve error handling, and enhance test coverage. The changes follow a structured approach to better organize the codebase and improve reliability when interacting with the ESPN API.

## Key Changes

### 1. Modular Directory Structure

The ESPN client implementation has been reorganized into a modular directory structure:

```
src/data/api/
├── __init__.py          # Export clean public API
├── async_client.py      # Base async client (unchanged)
├── rate_limiter.py      # Rate limiter (unchanged)
├── espn_client/         # ESPN-specific implementation
│   ├── __init__.py      # Export AsyncESPNClient, ESPNClient
│   ├── client.py        # Client implementation
│   ├── config.py        # Configuration handling
│   ├── teams.py         # Team-specific client methods
│   ├── games.py         # Game-specific client methods
│   └── players.py       # Player-specific client methods
└── espn_client.py       # Legacy file (removed)
```

Each component now has a clear responsibility and the code is more maintainable.

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery

Added an enhanced recovery mechanism that handles intermittent API issues:

- Implemented `get_with_enhanced_recovery` method with exponential backoff
- Added specific handling for `ServiceUnavailableError` and `ConnectionResetError`
- Configured automatic retries with increasing wait times
- Implemented proper logging at each recovery step

### 3. Player Stats Implementation

Completed the implementation of the player stats endpoint:

- Added `get_player_stats` method that retrieves player statistics
- Implemented season filtering support
- Added proper error handling and metadata tracking

### 4. Model Validation Improvements

Enhanced data models to handle inconsistent API responses:

- Added validators to handle different record formats in team responses
- Implemented handling for missing score fields in game responses
- Added support for missing position data in player responses

### 5. Expanded Test Coverage

Added comprehensive tests for all refactored components:

- Test cases for enhanced error recovery mechanism
- Tests for different API response formats and edge cases
- Tests for new player stats endpoint

## Future Improvements

Potential next steps for further improvements:

1. Add more comprehensive error handling for additional error types
2. Increase test coverage for edge cases
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Add pagination support for large result sets
5. Consider adding data transformation pipelines to standardize data structure
